## How it's made:
**Tech Used** HTML and CSS
I built this Tech Crunch prototype with HTML, CSS and used media queries to make it responsive.  

## Lesson Learned
I did struggle with one of the sections in Tech Crunch. It took me a few times to make it look as much like the newspaper as possible. Because of this struggle I revisited the site a few times until I got it right. At the end of everything, I am proud of the way my prototype came out.
